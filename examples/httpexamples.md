# http Examples

This is a file for demonstrating both server and client use of http in node with event-when style logic. 

We will setup a server that serves up a page generated from reading a file and grabbing the page at jostylr.com, combing through its links. Having to do both will demonstrate the usefulness of emitWhen, hopefully.
